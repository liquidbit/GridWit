The 1's in the road will be the road
The 0's are empty space where vehicles cannot travel

In theory this could be done with booleans as well
t - true
f - false

t f f f f f
t t f f f f
f t f f f f
f t t t t t
f f f f f t
f f f f t t
f f f f t f

But with numbers there is a possibility
of more than 0's and 1's which is more
desirable if some roads are stopped up or
if some roads are tolls or for any reason
there need be priority roads.
